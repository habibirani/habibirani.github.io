                        I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at <b>Texas State University</b>, working under the supervision of Dr. Vangelis Metsis at the <b>Intelligent Multimodal Computing and Sensing (IMICS) Laboratory</b>. My research focuses on developing innovative machine learning methods for time series analysis, with particular emphasis on Transformer-Based architectures and designing novel positional encoding techniques for temporal data. Prior to this, I earned my Master of Science in Information Systems in February 2022 from the Department of Computer Science at Shahid Beheshti University. I also hold a Bachelor of Science degree in Physics, which I obtained in September 2018 from the Department of Physics at the University of Tehran, Iran.

                        With more than five years of experience in the field of Machine Learning, I have cultivated a strong passion for research, particularly in the realm of machine learning with a focus on AI-powered applications in Smart Health and the utilization of Soft Computing algorithms, such as Genetics. My work bridges theoretical advances in machine learning with practical applications in smart health, computer vision, and large language models. I am passionate about creating robust, efficient, and interpretable AI systems that address real-world challenges.

                        My Master's thesis centered on the topic of "Tuning Hyperparameters of Gradient Descent,". This work resulted in the publication of a paper based on my thesis, titled <b>"Auto-tuning Hyperparameters of SGD Matrix Factorization-Based Recommender Systems Using Genetic Algorithm,"</b> presented at the 2022 IEEE International Conference on Omni-layer Intelligent Systems (COINS). I am proud to mention that this paper received recognition as the <b>best student paper</b> at the conference.

# Short description (appears on homepage)
short_bio: >
  I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Texas State University, working under the supervision of 
  Dr. Vangelis Metsis at the Intelligent Multimodal Computing and Sensing (IMICS) Laboratory. My research 
  focuses on developing innovative machine learning methods for time series analysis, with particular emphasis 
  on integrating Bayesian approaches with deep learning architectures and designing novel positional encoding 
  techniques for temporal data.

# Long description (appears below short bio)
long_bio: >
  My work bridges theoretical advances in machine learning with practical applications in smart health, 
  computer vision, and large language models. I am passionate about creating robust, efficient, and 
  interpretable AI systems that address real-world challenges.
